# calculating-factorial
ı actually wanna talk about RAM in this bc it might actually save you from all this non understadable work but ı dont think ı can do that with my poor explaining
this is actually very easy while format so ım not gonna talk about that
what i actually wanna say is that "why do we use another int so we can store the input"
and to answer to that is simple
you see when we use 'int' for an example we actually use from our Random Access Memomory (RAM) 
int has a 4 byte size so we used 4 byte from our ram and we stored our input or number or character etc.
and when we "give" a number to that it stores in that 4 bytes
but if wee use smth like divide subtract or any other thing that messes up with our inputs stored number                      
it just erase our number and write the new input                                  
(for example our input is 3 and we used like lets say: 'input++;' we have 4 as our stored input and we lost our original input)
so we just use a DIFFRENT storage (we use another int)as like backup
example for that
int ily;
int i love you == ily;
after that point when we our original input for smth we can always use it again bc of our other storage     
ı hope ı can help someone with this and if youre reading this 
thank you 🙂
